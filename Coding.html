	<h2 class="1Q">What is the difference between coding and programming?</h2>
	<p class="p1">Programming is a very broad term. A programmer tests, fixes, and debugs code. Coding is just turning normal english into a language that a computer can understand. A programmer takes the code that has been made by a coder and makes it into a computer program. They also fix any errors and maintain the program. Coders write up very basic code and give to a programmer for further development. For example, this website has been both coded and programmed by me!! I have fixed all of the errors that came up in the process of making it. If I were to make a a google doc with basic code on it, and give to someone to make it into a website, I would be considered as a coder.</p>

	<h2 class="2q">What is the point of coding when you can use programs such as google sites or wix to create a website?</h2>
	<p class="q2">Although these programs are really simple to use, they don't offer as much choice on what you want. Sometimes when you're building a website, you have a certain vision of what exactly you want. When you use Google Sites, Wix, Squarespace or any website designing software they offer a fixed amount of options to choose from. If you know how to code, the possibilities are endless. It is kind of like drawing. If you have a specific set of rules that the teacher has given you, you can't draw certain stuff exactly how you want, but if you don't have to conform to rules, you can make whatever you want.</p>

	<h2 class="3q">What is the difference between a front-end and back-end developer?</h2>
	<p class="p3">A front-end developer is a developer that handles the aesthetics and the looks of a website. Everything we see on a website is designed by a front-end developer. The code that allows the website to function is done by a back-end developer. The stuff that pops up when you press the inspect button on a website is mostly all done by a back-end developer.</p>

	<h2 class="4q">What are the most popular programming languages?</h2>
	<p class="p4">For programming, the most popular language is Python due to its simplicity. Java and Javascript are also very popular for programming. For making a basic website, HTML and CSS are usually used.</p>

<div class="q5">
	<h2 class="5q">What is the difference between Java and Javascript?</h2>
	<p class="p4">Java is very versatile in comparison to Javascript. Java is used to program websites, apps, and anything else that needs to be programmed. Javascript is only used for websites. Java is a standalone programming language. This means it doesn't depend on another language to program things. Javascript requires HTML and CSS to program the website before Javascript can be used.</p>
