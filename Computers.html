	<h2 class="1Q">What are the different types of memory in computers?</h2>
	<p class="p1">RAM and SSDs are the main type of internal memory in computers. RAM stands for random-access memory. It is pretty much the short-term memory of a computer. It handles the processing of information. Whenever we search something the RAM is used. SSD stands for Solid State Drive. It is the long term memory of the computer. Whenever you save something, the SSD keeps it from getting deleted. There are also many external memory devices such as CDs, USBs, and Memory cards. Although a computer only has a certain amount of storage in the SSD, you can increase the storage using an external drive.</p>

	<h2 class="2q">What is a super computer?</h2>
	<p class="q2">A super computer is a giant computer that is more powerful than a normal PC. Supercomputers are usually as large as an entire room. They use the same processors as a normal computer, but there are hundreds of them connected to eachother. The average computer has 8gb of RAM, but a super computer has hundreds or even thousands of gigabytes of RAM. It uses parallel processing in comparison to the serial processing system used in standard computers. Serial processing does one thing at a time so it is slower. It's kind of like doing a project all by yourself, you can't do it several things at once so you do one action at a time and it takes longer. Parallel processing systems work by taking a problem, breaking it down into small pieces, and then tackling multiple pieces at once. It's kind of like doing a group project if each person tackles a section of the assignment it will be done faster. </p>

	<h2 class="3q">Which is better: SSD or HDD?</h2>
	<p class="p3">First of all, SSDs and HDDs do the same thing, they are both the long-term memory of a computer. SSDs are mostly used in modern computers whereas older models use HDDs. SSDs are lighter, more cost-efficient, and more energy-efficient than HDDs. On the other hand, HDDs offer more storage than SSDs. HDDs are known for taking up more battery life and are heavier. HDDs are also slower than SSDs. So overall the SSD is better but if you are looking for a lot of storage the HDD would definitely be a better choice than an SSD. </p>
