	<h2 class="3q">What are the cons of robots?</h2>
	<p class="p3">Robots are taking over jobs contributing to higher rates of unemployment. Although robots are highly efficient at the task they are programmed for, they aren't great at handling unexpected tasks. This could lead to huge disasters in places where robots are employed. Robots also cost more than humans to maintain. Due to robots being technology, they could be hacked to cause disasters. And lastly, robots could take over the world you never know.ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬</p>

	<h2 class="4q">What are the pros of Robots?</h2>
	<p class="p4">Robots are more efficient than humans at doing their job. They can also work longer and don't require lunch breaks. Another benefit is that robots don't have feelings, therefore they won't hesitate to do any work(depending on the circumstances this can be a pro or con. If it's something like garbage clean-up, humans would be disgusted but robots won't care so its a pro.) Robots are also useful in jobs which would endanger human lives. THESE FACTORS STILL DO NOT OUTWEIGH THE FACT THAT ROBOTS ARE CAPABLE OF TAKING OVER THE WORLD!!!!!</p>
